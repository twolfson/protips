Caveat emptor: `+"Infinity"`

Smallest event emitter? `$('<i>')`

Thinnest deep clone: `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));`

Use #analytics on #sourcemaps to determine how many visitors are devs -- `app.get('my.uncompressed.js', function () { /* analytics */ });`

Clearly lexicographers never heard of namespacing before.

Escape a string with JSON.stringify - `JSON.stringify('"a"'); // "'\"a\"'"`

If an event is fired in a forest and there are no event listeners, does it make a sound?

If you're havin' async problems, I feel bad for you son. I got 99 problems but race conditions ain't one.

That feeling of when you are trapped and cannot be that create? There is a reason for that; the [Cathedral Effect](http://books.google.com/books?id=l0QPECGQySYC&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38).
