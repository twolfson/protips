Collection of thoughts -- some comical, some insightful. Without further ado:

Caveat emptor: `+"Infinity"`

Smallest event emitter? `$('<i>')`

Thinnest deep clone: `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));`

Use #analytics on #sourcemaps to determine how many visitors are devs -- `app.get('my.uncompressed.js', function () { /* analytics */ });`

Clearly lexicographers never heard of namespacing before.

Escape a string with JSON.stringify - `JSON.stringify('"a"'); // "'\"a\"'"`

If an event is fired in a forest and there are no event listeners, does it make a sound?
